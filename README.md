This plug-in adds auto-completion entries from the dictionary file.
Useful for very lazy typers like me or if you're searching for a particular word.

The default scopes where this plug-in is active are `comments`, `strings` and `text`. But you can customize them.

Just type <kbd>Ctrl + Space</kbd> to show auto-completion, or allow auto-complete to **always show suggestions** by changing your **'Settings - User'** for example like this:
```
"auto_complete_selector": "text, comment, string"
```

DictionaryAutoComplete takes the suggestions from the dictionary used for spell-checking by default.
But if you want you can set another one in the settings (for example a frequency dictionary).


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
   go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
search for **`DictionaryAutoComplete`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

Configuration
-------------
You can customize the following parameters in (a copy in `User` package folder of) `DictionaryAutoComplete.sublime-settings` :
- `encoding` : The dictionary encoding (like `"UTF-8"` or `"ISO-8859-1"`).
- `insert original` : If the default auto-completion list should be used or not.
- `maximum results` : The maximal number of results that this plug-in should return (for slower computer smaller number is better).
- `scopes` : Define the scopes where this plug-in is active.
- `minimal length` : The minimal length of a word to be completed (for slower computer you should play with this parameter to find what is optimal).
- `forbidden prefixes` : This allows to not auto-complete after some characters, which can be useful for compatibility with other plug-ins.
- `languages` : A language specific settings. Here you can overwrite all the previous settings for a particular language. Here is also the place to set an alternative dictionary if you want.
- `dictionary` : A path to alternative dictionary to use in place of the default dictionary used for spell-checking. This allows you for example to use a [frequency dictionary](https://github.com/kpym/FrequencyDictionaries/tree/master/freq_dicts_clean) that will show in first place the most used words.
- `smash characters`: Allows you to identify characters with accents in some languages. For example for French you can set
  ```
  "smash characters": ["eÃ©Ã¨ÃªÃ«", "aÃ Ã¢Ã¤", "cÃ§", "iÃ®Ã¯", "oÃ´Ã¶", "uÃ¹Ã»Ã¼", "yÃ¿"]
  ```
  and then when you type "lecon" it will suggest you "leÃ§on".
- `numeric shortcuts`: Change the way auto complete behaves. All the choices are numbered and pressing a number select the corresponding completion. If you use this setting you should probably set `maximum results` to less than 10.
- `dictionary symbol`: Is the symbol displayed on the right that is by default `ðŸ•®`. You can choose for example one of the Unicode book symbols: `ðŸ“’`, `ðŸ““`, `ðŸ“”`, `ðŸ“•`, `ðŸ“–`, `ðŸ“—`, `ðŸ“š`, `ðŸ“œ`, `ðŸ•®`.
- `reset on every key`: *[experimental]* By default ST do not refresh the auto-completion list on every key press.To overcome this we can force completion list refresh by first hiding then showing it. This is done when this setting is set to `true` (by default it is `false`).

Commands
--------
Two commands are added in the Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>):
- `Dictionary Auto Complete: Toggle` : Activate/deactivate this plug-in.
- `Auto Complete: Toggle` : Activate/deactivate the sublime auto-completion.
